      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Software that lets you edit a shared document together with others over the internet can be really useful if you’re working in a team, especially a distributed one. Nowadays, there is a lot of web-based software for simultaneous collaborative editing, no matter if you’re working on rich-text documents, spreadsheets, presentations or source code. Let’s take a moment to define more precisely what we mean with the term <em>realtime collaborative editing</em>.</p>
<p>What we want is that multiple people working at different computers can make changes to a document hosted on a server at any time. These changes are synchronized immediately with the other peers, in contrast to version control systems like Git, where one usually works on a feature all by oneself and eventually merges the changes back to the project. No client should have to communicate with the server or any other client <em>before</em> making a change. In particular, there is no need to acquire a lock from the server to make an edit and concurrent edits can occur. After all changes have been synchronized, every client should see the exact same document.</p>
<p>It turns out that implementing this kind of real-time collaboration is far from trivial. The most common solution responds to the name <em>Operational Transformation</em> (usually abbreviated <em>OT</em>). It originated from a <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=67544.66963">research paper</a> published in 1989 but got more recently popularized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave">Google Wave</a>. Today, it powers many collaborative editors such as</p>

<p>These are only a few examples from a growing number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor">applications with realtime collaboration</a>. I expect this number to rise even faster now that Google has published the Drive Realtime API, which is based on OT <!-- citation --> and let’s third-party apps use the same collaboration as Google Docs.</p>
<p>Operational Transformation has a reputation of being hard to understand. In my opinion, this reputation is hardly justified. I will try to convince you that despite the fancy name <em>Operation Transformation</em>, the ideas behind it are simple and mathematically elegant. To do this, we’re going to study the problem that OT solves in an idealized setting, thereby arriving at a working algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
<p>But first of all, what are <em>operations</em>? Simply put, operations are representations of changes to a document. For example, the action “set the stroke color of the star in the foreground to ‘purple’” is an operation on vector-based drawings. In rich-text editors, you may have the operation “mark the text ‘Hello’ in the first line as bold”. Many applications already support operations (under a different name of course) to implement undo/redo. In essence, an operation records the difference between one version of a document and the next.</p>
<p>For simplicity’s sake, we won’t consider rich-text documents or vector-based drawings. Instead we’re going to focus on plain-text documents for the rest of this introductory article. There are only two fundamental actions on text documents, which will be our definition of operations in this setting:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Insertions</dt>
<dd>An insertion consists of the inserted text and its position in the document. First, we’ll have to choose a coordinate system for our document. We could use a combination of line number and position within that line, but treating a document like a sequence of characters and giving the index (zero-based) index seems somewhat simpler. For brevity, we adapt the notation <span class="op-insert">Insert(“World”, 6)</span> for an insertion at position 6.
</dd>
<dt>Deletions</dt>
<dd>When we have insertions, we will of course support deletions, too. For example <span class="op-delete">Delete(5, 6)</span> is a deletion of 5 characters, beginning at position 6 (this would undo the insertion above).
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All other changes can be represented in terms of these two actions. For example, the replacement of a character with another has the same effect as a deletion of a character followed by an insertion at the same position. Below, you can edit and see the resulting operations on the right:</p>
<div id="operations-demo" class="demo row">
<div class="span6 offset3 well">
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;span4&quot;&gt;
    &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;span2 operations&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

  var STO = ot.SimpleTextOperation;

  // Breaks a `SimpleTextOperation` up into an array of `SimpleTextOperation`s

    if (operation instanceof STO.Noop) { return []; }
    var charOperations = [];
    if (operation instanceof STO.Insert) {
      for (var i = 0; i < operation.str.length; i++) {
        charOperations.push(new STO.Insert(
          operation.str.charAt(i),
          operation.position + i
